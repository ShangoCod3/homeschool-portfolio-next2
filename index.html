                <li> I haven't got much to show for science. I have attended science classes for homeschoolers at <a href="https://www.rockvillesciencecenter.org/classes"target="_blank">Rockville Science Center</a>, which has been really interesting.
				</li>
                <li> I have some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RPMqATQurpGKrA3o9" target="_blank">photos</a>of this experience. I lasted 6 weeks. I should be joining another session soon.
